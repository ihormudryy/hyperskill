<h2>The Range class</h2>
<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <p>The <code class="java">Range</code> class is supposed to represent an integer range. Its invariants restrict the start and the end of the range so that the value of the <code class="java">from</code> field is not greater than the one of the <code class="java">to</code> field.</p> 
  <p>Unfortunately, there's a chance that the invariants can break during serialization/deserialization. You need to improve the class so that it preserves the invariants during deserialization (i.e. <code class="java">from &lt;= to</code>). When the deserialized object breaks the invariant, throw <code class="java">IllegalArgumentException</code>. Pay attention to the constructor since it provides a good example of the required behavior.</p>
