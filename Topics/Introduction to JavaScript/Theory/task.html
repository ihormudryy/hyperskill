  <p>These days, it is difficult to find sites that do not allow visitors to interact with them. Think sliders, web galleries, animation and whatever other interactive events that pop out when you press some button. The processing of user input, the ability to send/receive data from servers and other interactive behavior are provided by <strong>JavaScript</strong>. </p> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">What is JavaScript</h2> 
  <p><strong>JavaScript (JS)</strong> is one of the most used programming languages. It was created by <em>Brendan Eich</em> in 1995, and it took him ten days. You read it right: JavaScript was really developed in just ten days!</p>

  <p>According to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.blog/2018-11-15-state-of-the-octoverse-top-programming-languages/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">GitHub 2018</a>, JS tops the list of the most popular programming languages. It is used for both front-end and back-end development. </p>

   JavaScript is 
   <u>not</u> Java. These are different programming languages. Their similar names were a marketing move to draw attention to the new language and take advantage of the popularity of Java.

  <p>JavaScript is based on the <strong>ECMAScript</strong> standard (often shortened to <strong>ES)</strong>. The latest version of this standard is <strong>ES11</strong>.</p> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">The first program</h2> 
  <p>Programs written in this language are called <strong>scripts</strong>. Here is an example of a simple JS script that prints <code class="language-javascript">I am starting to learn JavaScript!</code>:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log("I am starting to learn JavaScript!");</code></pre> 
  <p>All modern browsers have a built-in program that allows you to execute JS directly in them. Let's look at the result of our first program in the browser. To do this, press <em>Ctrl+Shift+J/Ctrl+Shift+K</em> or <em>Cmd+Opt+J/Cmd+Option+C</em> on Mac, write the JS code in the opened console, then press <em>Enter</em>.</p>

  <p>As you can see, the result of our first script was the line <code class="language-javascript">I am starting to learn JavaScript!</code>.</p> 
  <p>The browser console is not always easy to use, so you can also run this code <a target="_blank" href="http://repl.it/languages/javascript" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">on this site</a>.</p> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h2> 
  <p>JavaScript has a huge community of developers all over the world. This programming language is easy to learn and pleasant to write programs in. You will still come across difficulties, but when you do, you can always ask other programmers for help or even find <a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/javascript" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">a ready-made answer</a>! </p> 
  <p>There is a lot of new information in this topic, so we tried not to bore you with the history of JavaScript creation.
