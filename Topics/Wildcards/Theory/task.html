<h2>Wildcards</h2>
<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <p>Earlier, when we were discussing type bounds, we mentioned <em>Wildcards</em> as a feature that serves a similar purpose and has wide application.</p> 
  <p>Wildcards are a specific Java tool that allows the implementation of some compatibility between different generic objects. In essence, the wildcard is the "<strong>?"</strong> sign, used to indicate that a class, method, or field is compatible with different type parameters.</p> 
  <h2>Why Wildcards?</h2> 
  <p>As an object-oriented language, Java relies on the concept of inheritance. But since generics are type-safe structures, it is impossible to introduce inheritance for generic objects.</p> 
  <p>To illustrate this problem, let's consider two classes:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">class Book {}
class Album extends Book {}</code></pre> 
  <p>We might assume that a list of albums can be treated as a list of books because <code class="language-java">Album</code> is a subclass of <code class="language-java">Book</code>. But the compiler thinks differently:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">List&lt;Album&gt; albums = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
List&lt;Book&gt; books = albums; // compile-time error</code></pre> 
  <p>The root of the problem lies in the fact that <code class="language-java">List&lt;Album&gt;</code> is not a subclass of <code class="language-java">List&lt;Book&gt;</code>: inheritance does not apply to generic classes. Such behavior is known as invariance. It doesn't matter that <code class="language-java">Album</code> extends <code class="language-java">Book</code>, because containers like <code class="language-java">List&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code class="language-java">Set&lt;T&gt;</code> and others are treated like independent classes. </p> 
  <p>The example above is exactly where wildcards could help. A generic class or a method declared with wildcards can avoid inheritance issues. To implement wildcards, use "?" inside angle brackets (<code class="language-java">&lt;?&gt;</code>). Let's use it to address the compiler error: </p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">List&lt;Album&gt; albums = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
List&lt;? extends Book&gt; albumsAndBooks = albums; // it is ok</code></pre> 
  <p>or</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">List&lt;Album&gt; albums = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
List&lt;? super Album&gt; albumsAndBooks = albums; // it is ok as well</code></pre> 
  <p>Wildcards are commonly used with type bounds. In the type bounds article, we learned how to use the <code class="language-java">extends</code> keyword; now we will also take a look at the <code class="language-java">super</code> keyword. Since wildcards are used with type bounding, they can be divided into three groups: <em>unbounded</em> wildcards, <em>upper bounded</em> wildcards, and <em>lower bounded</em> ones.</p> 
  <h2>Upper Bounded Wildcards</h2> 
  <p>Upper Bounded Wildcards are used when we want to set an upper bound. It is set with the <code class="language-java">extends</code> keyword:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">? extends ReferenceType</code></pre> 
  <p>This code can be read as "any type that is a subtype of <code class="language-java">ReferenceType</code>". In other words, if <code class="language-java">S</code> is a subtype of <code class="language-java">T</code>, then type <code class="language-java">List&lt;S&gt;</code> is considered to be a subtype of <code class="language-java">List&lt;? extends T&gt;</code>. This feature is known as covariance.</p> 
  <p>Suppose that our program represents a library where we want to store only different types of books: normal books, booklets, photo albums, and so on. How would we avoid storing other media types such as audio recordings? Let's say that we have two more classes: </p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">public class Booklet extends Book {}
public class AudioFile {}</code></pre> 
  <p>We can use wildcards to create a list that stores only different types of books: </p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">List&lt;? extends Book&gt; storage = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();

List&lt;Album&gt; albums = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
storage = albums; // it works, Album is a subtype of Book

List&lt;Booklet&gt; booklets = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
storage = booklets; // it works, Booklet is a subtype of Book

List&lt;AudioFile&gt; recordings = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
storage = recordings; // compile-time error, AudioFile is not a subtype of Book</code></pre> 
  <p>By using an upper-bounded wildcard, we made sure that the storage variable can only be set to subtypes of <code class="language-java">Book</code>.</p> 
  <p>Now let's consider another limitation of upper bounding.</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">/**
* Hierarchy: Book -&gt; Album
*                 -&gt; Booklet
* Allowed types: List&lt;Book&gt;, List&lt;Album&gt;, List&lt;Booklet&gt;
*/
public void upperBoundedMethod(List&lt;? extends Book&gt; books) {
    Book book = books.get(0); // It is fine

    books.add(new Album()); // compile-time error
    books.add(new Book());  // compile-time error
    books.add(null); // also fine, because of null is a special type-independent value
}</code></pre> 
  <p>Surprisingly, some lines of <code class="language-java">upperBoundedMethod</code> won't compile. Upper bounded wildcards are able to read content as a <code class="language-java">Book</code> type, but they are not able to write any content except for a null value.</p> 
  <p>Let's explain the logic behind these read and write permissions. Because the method accepts lists parameterized by <code class="language-java">Book</code> or any of its subtypes (<code class="language-java">List&lt;Books&gt;</code>, <code class="language-java">List&lt;Album&gt;</code> or <code class="language-java">List&lt;Booklet&gt;</code>), any argument can be read as an object of type <code class="language-java">Book</code>. Writing to a wildcard argument, however, is prohibited to avoid runtime errors. To see why, suppose that a <code class="language-java">List&lt;Album&gt;</code> was passed in, but then we try to add an instance of <code class="language-java">Book</code> to this list. This <code class="language-java">Book</code> object will be treated as an <code class="language-java">Album</code> object in the future, which will likely lead to a runtime error.</p> 
  <h2>Lower Bounded Wildcards</h2> 
  <p>Lower bounded Wildcards are introduced with the <code class="language-java">super</code> keyword followed by the lower bound:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">? super ReferenceType</code></pre> 
  <p>This means "any type that is a supertype of <code class="language-java">ReferenceType</code>". For example, if <code class="language-java">S</code> is a supertype of <code class="language-java">T</code>, then <code class="language-java">List&lt;S&gt;</code> is considered to be a supertype of <code class="language-java">List&lt;? super T&gt;</code>. This feature is called contravariance.</p> 
  <p>Let's think of books again. Now we would like to write code that will enable a list of <code class="language-java">Albums</code> and its superclasses to be added to a general library.</p> 
  <p>Take a look at the following code:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">List&lt;? super Album&gt; storage = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();

List&lt;Album&gt; albums = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
storage = albums; // it works

List&lt;Book&gt; books = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
storage = books; // it works, Book is a supertype for Album

List&lt;Booklet&gt; booklets = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
storage = booklets; // compile-time error, Booklet is not a supertype for Album</code></pre> 
  <p>Here we made sure that only supertypes of the <code class="language-java">Album</code> class can be added to the storage.</p> 
  <p>Now let's consider some limitations of lower bounding.</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">/**
* Hierarchy: Album &lt;- Book &lt;- Object  
* Allowed types: List&lt;Album&gt;, List&lt;Book&gt;, List&lt;Object&gt;
*/
public void lowerBoundedMethod(List&lt;? super Album&gt; albums) {
    Object object = albums.get(0); // it is ok. Object is upper bound of Album
    Book book = albums.get(0);     // compile-time error
    Album album = albums.get(0);   // compile-time error

    albums.add(new Object()); // compile-time error
    albums.add(new Book());   // compile-time error
    albums.add(new Album());  // OK
    albums.add(null);         // OK, null is type-independent
}</code></pre> 
  <p>Similarly to upper-bounded wildcards, certain actions involving lower-bounded wildcards lead to compile-time errors. Since any of <code class="language-java">List&lt;Album&gt;</code>, <code class="language-java">List&lt;Book&gt;</code>, <code class="language-java">List&lt;Object&gt;</code> can be passed to <code class="language-java">lowerBoundedMethod</code>, we can't assert that the object being read has type <code class="language-java">Album</code> or <code class="language-java">Book</code>. We can only be certain that it has type <code class="language-java">Object</code>, since all classes inherit from <code class="language-java">Object</code>.</p> 
  <p>While <code class="language-java">Object</code> is the only type that can be read from albums, <code class="language-java">Album</code> is the only type that can be added. The reason is that only an instance of <code class="language-java">Album</code> can also be treated as an instance of <code class="language-java">Book</code> and <code class="language-java">Object</code>. If we tried to add an instance of <code class="language-java">Book</code>, this instance would be treated as <code class="language-java">Album</code> in the future. The compiler prevents such errors by issuing a compiler-time warning. </p> 
  <h2>Get and Put Principle</h2> 
  <p>To decide whether extends or super should be used, it is worth remembering the Get and Put principle:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li> <p>Use upper bounded wildcards when you only get values out of a structure (i.e. when you use only getters or similar methods).</p> </li> 
   <li> <p>Use lower bounded wildcards when you only put values into a structure (i.e. when you use only setters or similar methods). </p> </li> 
   <li> <p>Use Unbounded Wildcards (simply &lt;?&gt;) when you both get and put values (i.e. when you need to use both getters and setters).</p> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p></p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
   Note that putting values may require an extra step to avoid errors — we discuss this in the following section.
  </div>
  <p></p> 
  <p>To memorize this principle, you can also use PECS: Producer Extends, Consumer Super. This means that if you get a value from a generic class, method, or any other object that produces what you need, you use extends. If you put or set a value into a generic class, method, or any other object that consumes what you put in, you use super.</p> 
  <p>Remember that it is not possible to put anything into a type declared with the <code class="language-java">extends</code> wildcard except for the null value, which can represent any reference type. Similarly, it is not possible to retrieve anything from a type declared with super wildcard except for an instance of <code class="language-java">Object</code>, the parent of every reference type.</p> 
  <p></p>
  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    You cannot use both a lower and an upper bound in wildcards or type bounds.
  </div>
  <p></p> 
  <p>Note that a class or interface used with the <code class="language-java">extends</code> or <code class="language-java">super</code> keyword is itself included in the inheritance. For example, <code class="language-java">Box&lt;T&gt;</code> is compatible and covariant with <code class="language-java">Box&lt;? extends T&gt; or Box&lt;? super T&gt;</code>.</p> 
  <p>Also note that the unbounded wildcard <code class="language-java">?</code> is equivalent to <code class="language-java">? extends Object</code>.</p> 
  <p></p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
    Remember that the purpose of inheritance prohibition in generics is to prevent run-time errors; otherwise, generics would lose their type safety.
  </div>
  <p></p> 
  <h2>Wildcard capture</h2> 
  <p>Let's consider the example:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">public static void reverse(List&lt;?&gt; list) {
  List&lt;Object&gt; tmp = new ArrayList&lt;Object&gt;(list);
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; list.size(); i++) {
    list.set(i, tmp.get(list.size() - i - 1)); // compile-time error
  }
}</code></pre> 
  <p>What causes the compile-time error? Recall that <code class="language-java">&lt;?&gt;</code>is equivalent to <code class="language-java">&lt;? extends Object&gt;</code>. The compiler signals an error because it does not know the type of object being written to the list. The scenario is known as the wildcard capture problem and can be solved by the trick:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">public static void reverse(List&lt;?&gt; list) { 
  reverseCaptured(list); 
}

private static &lt;T&gt; void reverseCaptured(List&lt;T&gt; list) {
  List&lt;T&gt; tmp = new ArrayList&lt;T&gt;(list);
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; list.size(); i++) {
    list.set(i, tmp.get(list.size() - i - 1));
  }
}</code></pre> 
  <p>Here we introduced a helper method <code class="language-java">reverseCaptured</code> which has a parameter of a certain type <code class="language-java">T</code> for all elements of a list. The method is error-free because it is merely a generic method; it does not face any restrictions due to wildcards.</p> 
  <h2>Conclusion</h2> 
  <p>Wildcards are a convenient and safe way of implementing an equivalent of inheritance in Generics. They are declared with the <code class="language-java">&lt;?&gt;</code> symbol and are widely used with upper or lower bounds to restrict type parameters.</p>
