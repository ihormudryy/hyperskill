<h2>Inverting streams</h2>
<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <p>There is a new challenge. Someone has not correctly chosen the types of streams in a program (parallel and sequential).</p> 
  <p>You need to implement a method that inverses the state of every stream from the given list (parallel â†’ sequential and vice versa).</p> 
  <p>The method should return a new list of streams which are inverted.</p> 
  <p>Try to use streams to solve this problem.</p>
