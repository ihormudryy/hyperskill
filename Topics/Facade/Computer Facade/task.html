  <p>In this task, you will implement almost a full code. Your computer is some kind of a facade for you as a user, or, as developers put it, a client<em>. </em>Let's create a simple <em>ComputerFacade </em>with <em>Processor, Monitor and Keyboard</em> subsystems. When you turn on this computer, the <em>Processor</em> will start first, then the <em>Monitor</em>, and finally, the <em>Keyboard</em>. But be careful because your keyboard has a backlight feature, and the order of turning the elements off should be correct!</p>
