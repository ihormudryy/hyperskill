 <body>
  <p>You need to implement a method that returns a prepared stream for detecting bad words. The method has two parameters:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>a text in which all words are divided by single whitespaces;</li> 
   <li>a list of bad words.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The returned stream should contain dictionary ordered (i.e., sorted lexicographically) elements that do not repeat.</p>
