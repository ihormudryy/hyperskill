  <p>If you would like to create your own superhero, what would you do? Of course, you would open a favorite development environment and create a class <code class="language-java">Superhero</code>! </p> 
  <p>To be a proper one, our superhero will need a set of special items, including, for example, a magic cloak or a hammer. Here may come a problem. What is the best way to organize the classes describing the equipment? And how to mark that only one class, that is <code class="language-java">Superhero</code>, can use them? </p> 
  <p>Here appears our savior — an instrument called <strong>nested classes</strong>. They help us to group classes logically and increase the encapsulation of our code.</p> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">What is a nested class?</h2> 
  <p>Basically, you can call a class <strong>nested</strong> when it is declared inside another class.</p> 
  <p>This is how our superhero would look like: </p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">class Superhero {
    
    class MagicCloak {
        
    }
    
    class Hammer {

    }
}</code></pre> 
  <p>Both classes <code class="language-java">MagicCloak</code> and <code class="language-java">Hammer</code> are nested classes. The <code class="language-java">Superhero</code> class is often called an <strong>outer class</strong><em>,</em><strong><em> </em></strong>and a nested class is called a <strong>member </strong>of an outer class.</p> 
  <p>In this topic, we are going to talk about <strong>non-static nested classes, </strong>that are commonly known as i<strong>nner classes</strong>.</p> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Inner class</h2> 
  <p>Let's move to another example. Imagine that you are writing a class <code class="language-java">Cat</code> representing cats. The cat may have a lot of fields and methods, but we may also use inner class structures. For example, let's say you want a cat to have a bow. Then you need to create a new class <code class="language-java">Bow</code>. This class <code class="language-java">Bow</code> would be quite small and specific, and you know you won't need a bow without a cat. The solution is to create a class <code class="language-java">Bow</code> inside the class <code class="language-java">Cat</code>:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">public class Cat {

    private String name;

    public Cat(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public class Bow {
        String color;

        public Bow(String color) {
            this.color = color;
        }

        public void printColor() {
            System.out.println("Cat " + Cat.this.name + " has a " + this.color + " bow.");
        }
    }
}</code></pre> 
  <p>Let's create a cat <code class="language-java">Bob</code> with a red bow:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Cat cat = new Cat("Bob");
        Cat.Bow bow = cat.new Bow("red");

        bow.printColor();
    }
}</code></pre> 
  <p>Look, we have created an instance of <code class="language-java">Cat</code> and then created an instance of <code class="language-java">Bow</code> using quite interesting syntax.</p> 
  <p>Here, the output will be:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">Cat Bob has a red bow.</code></pre> 
  <p>Remember that to use inner classes we must <em>create an instance of the outer class. </em>In our example, we created a <code class="language-java">Cat</code>.</p> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Scope of the inner class</h2> 
  <p>Now let's discuss what we can see from the inner class and who can access the inner class from outside.</p> 
  <p>There is our class <code class="language-java">Cat</code> with new method <code class="language-java">sayMeow</code> and an inner class <code class="language-java">Bow</code> with new method <code class="language-java">putOnABow</code> .</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">public class Cat {

    private String name;

    public Cat(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    private void sayMeow() {
        System.out.println(this.name + " says: \"Meow\".");
    }

    public class Bow {
        String color;

        public Bow(String color) {
            this.color = color;
        }

        public void putOnABow() {            
            Cat.this.sayMeow();
            System.out.println("Bow is on!");
        }

        public void printColor() {
            System.out.println("Cat " + Cat.this.name + " has a " + this.color + " bow.\n");
        }
    }
}</code></pre> 
  <p>Note, that inside the method <code class="language-java">putOnABow</code> of class <code class="language-java">Bow</code> we have access to the private method <code class="language-java">sayMeow</code> of class <code class="language-java">Cat</code>. And, as you can see, in the method <code class="language-java">sayMeow</code> we print the private field <code class="language-java">name</code> of class <code class="language-java">Cat</code> and everything works fine.<br> Also in the method <code class="language-java">printColor</code> we have direct access to the private field <code class="language-java">name</code> of class <code class="language-java">Cat</code>.</p> 
  <p>How about cat Princess with a golden bow to prove that our code works?</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">Cat cat = new Cat("Princess");
Cat.Bow bow = cat.new Bow("golden");

bow.printColor();
bow.putOnABow();</code></pre> 
  <p>And, yes, the bow is on!</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">Cat Princess has a golden bow.

Princess says: "Meow".
Bow is on!</code></pre> 
  <p>As for the scope from the outside world: when you've instantiated an inner class, you can do whatever you want according to access modifiers.<br> Now let's collect all rules together and put them into a human "hard disk"!</p> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Rules for Inner classes</h2> 
  <p>Inside the inner class, we can see all methods and fields of an outer class even if they are <code class="language-java">private</code>. And don't forget that we can use everything else according to access modifiers as well.</p> 
  <p>An inner class is associated with an instance of its enclosing class. So to instantiate an inner class and get access to it you need to instantiate an outer class first:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">Outer outer = new Outer();
Outer.InnerClass inner = outer.new InnerClass();</code></pre> 
  <p></p>
  <div class="alert alert-warning">
   Remember about access modifiers
   <strong>:</strong> if you make inner class 
   <code class="language-java">private</code>, then it can only be accessed 
   <em>inside</em> the outer class. The same works with fields and methods.
  </div>
  <p></p> 
  <p>And be careful — there are always some restrictions!</p> 
  <p>Inside an inner class, you <strong>cannot </strong>define: </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Any static members;</li> 
   <li>Enum;</li> 
   <li>Interface.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Reasons to use Inner Classes </h2> 
  <p>Have you noticed what our examples about <code class="language-java">Superhero</code> with magic items and <code class="language-java">Cat</code> with a bow have in common? Sure you have — we hid our inner classes from the outside world. So that only <code class="language-java">Superhero</code> may use a magic cloak and only a <code class="language-java">Cat</code> may put on a bow. Also now it will be easier to navigate between classes and to understand the structure of your code.</p> 
  <p>And, at last, the formal (just a little bit) list of reasons:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li>they increase <strong>encapsulation. </strong>Our <code class="language-java">Bow</code> is only for <code class="language-java">Cat</code>. You can make a field (method) <code class="language-java">private</code> and hide it from other classes, using only inside the inner class.</li> 
   <li>It will <strong>organize </strong>your code and help your packages be more reasonable, as with all magic equipment for <code class="language-java">Superhero</code> being in one place. </li> 
  </ol> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Summary</h2> 
  <p>You can create a class within another class and such classes are called nested. A non-static nested class is called an inner class. We hope you are ready to use it. Just don't forget to instantiate an outer class first!</p> 
  <p>The main idea of Inner classes is to hide some code from other classes and increase encapsulation.</p>
