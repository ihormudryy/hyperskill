<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>In this stage, you will build upon the functionality of the program that you wrote in the first stage. The server should be able to receive messages <code class="java">get</code>, <code class="java">set</code>, and <code class="java">delete</code> with an index of the cell. You also need to extend the database to 1000 cells (1-1000).</p>

<p>There is no need to save files on the hard drive, so if the server reboots, all the data will be lost. The server should serve one client at a time in a loop, and the client should only send one request to the server, get one reply, and exit. After that, the server should wait for another connection.</p>

<p>Since the server cannot shut down by itself and testing requires the program to stop at a certain point, you should implement a way to stop the server. When the client sends <code class="java">exit</code>, the server should stop. In a normal situation when there's no testing needed, you shouldn't allow this behavior.</p>

<p>To send a request to the server, the client should get all the information through command-line arguments. These arguments include the type of the request (set, get, or delete), the index of the cell, and, in the case of the <code class="java">set</code> request, a text.</p>

<p>There is a good library to parse all the arguments called <code class="java">JCommander</code>. It is included in our project setup, so you can use it without any installation. Before you get started with it, we recommend you check out a <a target="_blank" href="http://jcommander.org" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">JCommander tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>The arguments will be passed to the client in the following format:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">-t set -i 148 -m Here is some text to store on the server</code></pre>

<p><code class="java">-t</code> is the type of the request, and <code class="java">-i</code> is the index of the cell. <code class="java">-m</code> is the value to save in the database: you only need it in case of a <code class="java">set</code> request.</p>

<p>The server and the client are different programs that run separately. Your server should run from the main method of the <em>/server/Main</em> class, and the client should run from the main method of the <em>/client/Main</em> class.</p>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

<p>Starting the server:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; java Main
Server started!</code></pre>

<p>Starting the clients:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; java Main -t get -i 1
Client started!
Sent: get 1
Received: ERROR</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; java Main -t set -i 1 -m "Hello world!"
Client started!
Sent: set 1 Hello world!
Received: OK</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; java Main -t set -i 1 -m HelloWorld!
