<p>Chat programs usually have a client/server architecture. This means that there are a lot of clients and a single server, although for chats with a really big audience, there can be more servers. All clients connect to this server and the server handles the clients' messages.</p>

<p>An important term to know in this stage is <strong>socket</strong>. A socket is an interface to exchange data between different processes. These processes can be on the same computer or on different machines connected through the Internet. The clients in the client/server architecture have only one open socket; they are only connected to the server. However, the server has a lot of open sockets — one for each connected client.</p>

<p>In this stage, you will implement the simplest connection between one server and one client. The client and the server get a text from the standard input. Both the client and the server should send the received messages to each other and print them. When the client disconnects, the server should terminate.</p>

<p>To connect to the server, the client must know the address of the server. The address consists of two parts: IP-address and port. The address of your computer is always "127.0.0.1", so you can use this address in your program. The port can be any number from 0 to 65535, but preferably greater than 1024. The IP address and port of the client should be the same as those of the server; otherwise, the client won't find the server, and the server won't know about the client.</p>

<p>To start, you need to import <code class="language-language-java">java.io.*</code> and <code class="language-language-java">java.net.*</code> to avoid importing problems.</p>

<p>Let's look at the client-side code:</p>

<pre><code class="language-language-java">String address = "127.0.0.1";
int port = 23456;
Socket socket = new Socket(InetAddress.getByName(address), port);
DataInputStream input = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());
DataOutputStream output = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());</code></pre>

<p>The client creates a new socket. This means that they're trying to connect to the server. The successful creation of a socket means that the client found the server and connected to it.</p>

<p>After that, you can see the creation of the <code class="language-language-java">DataInputStream</code> and <code class="language-language-java">DataOutputStream</code> objects. These are the input and output connections to this server. If you expect to receive data from the server, you need to write <code class="language-language-java">input.readUTF().</code> This returns the String object that the server sent to the client. If you want to send data to the server, you need to write <code class="language-language-java">output.writeUTF(stringText)</code> and this message will be sent to the server.</p>

<p>Now let's look at this server-side code:</p>

<pre><code class="language-language-java">String address = "127.0.0.1";
int port = 23456;
ServerSocket server = new ServerSocket(port, 50, InetAddress.getByName(address));
Socket socket = server.accept();
DataInputStream input = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());
DataOutputStream output  = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());</code></pre>

<p>The server creates a ServerSocket object that waits for client connections. When a client connects, the <code class="language-language-java">server.accept()</code> method returns the Socket connection to this client. After that, you can see the creation of the <code class="language-language-java">DataInputStream</code> and <code class="language-language-java">DataOutputStream</code> objects, which are the input and output connections to this client, now from the server side. To receive data from the client, you need to write <code class="language-language-java">input.readUTF()</code>. To send data to the client, write <code class="language-language-java">output.writeUTF(stringText)</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, the programs can’t start simultaneously: they need to be connected correctly after they are prepared to work. The main method of the client should be located in the class <code class="language-language-java">chat.client.Client</code>, and the server's main method should be located in the class <code class="language-language-java">chat.server.Server</code>. Write your client code in the package <code class="language-language-java">chat.client</code> and your server code in the package <code class="language-language-java">chat.server</code>.</p>

<p><code class="language-language-java">input.readUTF()</code> and <code class="language-language-java">socket.accept()</code> can hold a thread, be careful!</p>

<p>Be careful with closing resources. This may cause the unexpected behavior of your programs.</p>

<p>Also, the client should print <code class="language-language-java">Client started!</code> and the server should print <code class="language-language-java">Server started!</code> at the start of the program.</p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;">Example</h5>

<p>For the following input for the server:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Hello from the server!
Let’s text!</code></pre>

<p>and the following input for the client :</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">I am connected!
Let’s go!</code></pre>

<p>The server should output: </p>

<pre><code class="language-language-java">Server started!
I am connected!
Let’s go!</code></pre>

<p>The client should output:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Client started!
Hello from the server!
Let’s text!</code></pre>
