<h5 style="text-align: center;">Description</h5>

<p>First, let's create a moderation system. Imagine that someone is spamming messages to everyone on the server. Of course, there should be a way to kick such spammers out! To achieve that, the server should store a list of the moderators’ login information on the hard drive. When one of the moderators sends the message <code class="java">/kick NAME</code> to the server, the user with the name NAME should be kicked out of the server for 5 minutes. During these 5 minutes, the server should reject any login attempts from this user.</p>

<p>Also, create an admin whose username is always "admin". The admin should be able to add and remove moderators in the system. To add a moderator, the admin needs to type <code class="java">/grant NAME</code>, and to remove a moderator, <code class="java">/revoke NAME</code>. Of course, the admin should be able to kick users out of the server. Note that the moderator <strong>can</strong> kick out the users but <strong>cannot</strong> kick out the other moderators. The admin can kick out both users and moderators. Nobody can kick out the admin, not even the admin!</p>

<p>The second major improvement involves unread messages. When a user types <code class="java">/unread</code>, the server should send back a list of users who have sent unread messages. When the user types <code class="java">/chat NAME</code> to go to the correspondence with the user NAME, the server should send the last 10 read messages and all unread messages on top of that. Note: the server must never send more than 25 messages at a time. After, all the messages from this conversation should be marked as read. For example, if there are 22 unread messages, the server should send them and 3 read messages on top of that. If there are 26 unread messages, the server should send the last 25 unread messages, but mark all 26 as read.</p>

<p>Also, let's add some useful functions for the user. Right now, it is impossible to read old messages, other than the 10 last messages. Let's fix that: if the user sends <code class="java">/history N</code>, the server should send back <em>N</em> last messages of the current conversation. To protect the server from the users trying to request the last million messages, the server should send back no more than 25 messages. So, if the user asks for the last 250 messages, the server should send back a list of 25 messages: the messages 250 to 226 (inclusive) back in the conversation.</p>

<p>Another useful feature is statistics. If the user types <code class="java">/stats</code>, the server should send the statistics of the current conversation. The statistics consist of the total number of messages in the conversation, the total number of messages sent by that user, and the total number of messages sent by the user you’re talking to.</p>

<ol>
	<li>If a client sends a message to another user who doesn’t “<em>/chat</em>” with them, then the message should be only saved.</li>
	<li>If a client tries to send a message before choosing the addressee, the server should send the following message:<br>
	<code class="java">Server: use /list command to choose a user to text!</code></li>
	<li>If a client tries to send a message or a command before auth, the server should send the following message:<br>
	<code class="java">Server: you are not in the chat!</code></li>
	<li>The server should check the login before checking the password and send only the following error message:<br>
	<code class="java">Server: incorrect login!</code></li>
	<li>Keep in mind that messages that were sent to you when you weren't chatting with this person should be shown with prefix <code class="java">(new)</code> at the start on a message but shouldn’t be saved with it;</li>
	<li>Neither the server nor the client should react to a command more than described in the stage.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the admin, use login <code class="java">admin</code> and password <code class="java">12345678</code>.</p>

<p>Below is a list of commands and their possible technical messages. Note that the words in uppercase should be replaced with actual data.</p>

	Server: you are no longer a moderator!</li>
	<li><code class="java">/unread</code><br>
	a. Server: unread from: USER_A USER_B (etc)<br>
	The user list should be sorted alphabetically.<br>
	b. Server: no one unread</li>
	<li><code class="java">/stats</code><br>
	Server:<br>
	Statistics with USER:<br>
	Total messages: COUNT<br>
	Messages from YOU: Х<br>
	Messages from USER: X</li>
	<li><code class="java">/history</code><br>
	a. Server: X is not a number!<br>
	b. Server:<br>
	MESSAGE_1<br>
	MESSAGE_2<br>
	(etc)</li>
