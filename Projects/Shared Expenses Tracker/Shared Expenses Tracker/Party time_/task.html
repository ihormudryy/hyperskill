<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Tired of all work and no play, your colleagues are going to throw a big outdoor party, which can only mean one thing: a lot of complicated bill splitting... A group bus ticket should be split among the passengers, and fuel bills should be grouped by car. When it comes to food, some people will have to be excluded from the bill for certain categories: vegans will not pay for meat, healthy food enthusiasts shouldn't have to chip in for sugary soda, etc.</p>

<p>You've already done some bill splitting using a database. The database allows to query large amounts of data with decent performance. Although databases are effective when it comes to querying, using it to process small collections may be a bit of an overshot. This is where Stream API comes in!</p>

<p>Below you can find a list of close approximations of SQL for stream API : </p>

<p>Note that DomainClass represents your POJO objects.</p>

<h5>Objectives</h5>

<p>In this stage, your program should be able to:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Work with Spring boot console application.</li>
	<li>Process the following command:<br>
	<code class="java">[date] <strong>balance</strong><strong> </strong>[open|close] [(list of [+|-] persons | GROUPS)]</code></li>
	<li>Process complex shared purchases and repayments.</li>
	<li>Calculate and display the list of repayments with names and amounts to be repaid.</li>
</ol>

<p>Use database name <code class="java">spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:file:../testDB.mv.db</code> for testing.</p>

<h5>Examples</h5>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. <br>
The program should print a list of commands:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; help
balance
borrow
cashBack
exit
group
help
purchase
repay
secretSanta
writeOff</code></pre>

<p>Complex splitting without filtering, and filtered by (-Frank, CAR, Chuck):</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; writeOff
&gt; group create TEAM (Ann, Bob, Chuck, Diana, Elon, Frank)
&gt; group create CAR (Diana, Elon)
&gt; group create BUS (Ann, Bob, Chuck, Frank)
&gt; purchase Chuck busTickets 5.25 (BUS, -Frank)
&gt; purchase Elon fuel 25 (CAR, Frank)
&gt; purchase Ann chocolate 2.99 (BUS, -Bob, CAR)
&gt; purchase Diana soda 5.45 (TEAM, -Ann, -Chuck)
&gt; purchase Frank bbq 29.90 (TEAM, CAR, BUS, -Frank, -Bob)
&gt; cashBack YourCompany party 12 (TEAM, BUS)
&gt; cashBack YourCompany tickets 3.50 (BUS)
