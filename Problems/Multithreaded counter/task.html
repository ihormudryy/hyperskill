<h2>Multithreaded counter</h2>
<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <p>Here's a class named <code class="java">Counter</code>. The class has a single field <code class="java">count</code>. An instance of the class is accessed by different threads concurrently. Each thread invokes the method <code class="java">inc</code> to increment the field many times.</p> 
  <p>After the completion of all threads, this field has an incorrect value.</p> 
  <p>Fix the code, so that it can work correctly with multiple threads. Do not make the class public.</p> 
  <p><strong>Example:</strong></p> 
  <p>Let's assume we have one instance of <code class="java">Counter</code> and two threads. Each thread invokes the method <code class="java">inc</code> 5000000 times. If everything works correctly after the completion of both threads <code class="java">count</code> must be 10000000.</p>
